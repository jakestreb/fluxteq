  desc: "Heat flux sensors can be placed on windows and walls to determine where heat is being \
    lost at certain times of the day and in certain weather conditions. \
    For example, if there is wind or rain hitting a building from a certain direction, this will \
    cause an increased amount of heat transfer on the building's side that is exposed to these \
    conditions. \
    Placing heat flux sensors at various locations within a building can help determine where \
    heat is being lost/gained so that heating or cooling loads can be directed to specific zones \
    of buildings to save energy."

  desc: "Knowledge of the thermal properties of certain materials is essential for a wide variety \
    of applications. Heat flux sensors can be used in conjunction with temperature sensors, either \
    separately packaged or built-in, to determine thermal properties of materials such as thermal \
    conductivity (k) or thermal insulation resistance (R\" or R-value). Use heat flux and temperature \
    sensors together to measure R-values/ U-values of insulation, windows, and other materials."

    velocity of internal fluid flow. With flow velocity and other flow characteristics, BTU metering \
    information can also be calculated."

  name: "Wearable technology",

  desc: "The direct measurement of heat flux is the most accurate method to estimate calories burned. \
    The body responds differently with different exercises and in different climate conditions. \
    Heat flux sensors can help to constantly keep track of how much heat, or essentially calories, \
    a body is losing in such conditions."

  desc: "The heat flux sensors have been used in various systems to measure blood perfusion, or \
    blood flow to skin tissue. These systems could be used for a wide range of applications \
    including bedsore monitoring and prevention therapy, organ transplant preservation, skin cancer \
    detection and burned tissue severity evaluation. FluxTeq has begun development of such systems \
    and hope to commercialize them in the near future. Contact us if you are interested in \
    participating in a collaborative research effort to do so."

    engineering students all across the United States without the students ever learning the \
    difference between heat and temperature. FluxTeq has determined that the lack of hands-on \
    experience with basic thermal conditions can cause students to confuse underlying concepts \
    in the subject of heat transfer. \
    FluxTeq has designed and implemented heat transfer workshops that have been used by hundreds \
    of engineering students. These workshops use both heat flux and temperature sensors in a variety \
    of experimental situations to help the students learn the fundamentals of heat transfer hands-on."
